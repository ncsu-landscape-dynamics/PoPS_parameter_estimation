# MCMC Parameter Estimate for PoPS Model <img src="www/PoPS_Logo.png" align="right" width="14%" />

## Overview

Parameter estimator using MCMC for [PoPS R Wrapper](https://github.com/ncsu-landscape-dynamics/rpops) which uses [PoPS C++ library](https://github.com/ncsu-landscape-dynamics/PoPShttps://github.com/ncsu-landscape-dynamics/PoPS). PoPs is a stochastic spread model of pests and pathogens in forest and agricultural landscapes. It has been generalized and new features added but was originally developed for *Phytophthora ramorum* and the original version of the model was based on this reference paper: Ross K. Meentemeyer, Nik J. Cunniffe, Alex R. Cook, Joao A. N. Filipe, Richard D. Hunter, David M. Rizzo, and Christopher A. Gilligan 2011. Epidemiological modeling of invasion in heterogeneous landscapes: spread of sudden oak death in California (1990â€“2030). *Ecosphere* 2:art17.
